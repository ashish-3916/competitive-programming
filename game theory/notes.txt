GAME OF NIM 
    The current player has a winning strategy if and only if the xor-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero. 
    The xor-sum of a sequence a is a1⊕a2⊕…⊕an, where ⊕ is the bitwise exclusive or.
    proof is kinda easy ..... if we get non zero nim we try to make it zero so other player loses.
    so we find leftmost set bit , change it from any pile having that bit set .... and also then change
    remainng set bits of nim sum to 0 accordingly by toggling 0/1 from the pile chosen

GRUNDY NUMBERS
    MEX -> smallest non negative missing value
    GRUNDY(n) = MEX(GRUNDY(i) , )  where i is any state
    GRUNDY(0) = 0;
